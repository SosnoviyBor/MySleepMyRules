# My Sleep, My Rules (OpenMW)

Configure your own sleeping and resting experiences.

> **Sleeping** = sleeping on bed or on anything similar\
> **Resting** = resting on the ground or loitering in the city

## Options
### Resting Conditions
- Disable resting in interiors with white- and blacklist
- Disable resting in interiors if there are any enemies in it
- Disable resting in exteriors with white- and blacklist
- Disable resting in exteriors in bad weather (rain, ash storm, snow storm)
- Override safe distance from enemies - [Not sure it's possible, gotta test it first]
### Resource Replenishing (separate for both sleeping and resting)
- Disable health regeneration
- Disable magicka regeneration
- Disable fatigue regeneration

## Installation
Installs like any other OpenMW mod. Not sure about pre-0.49 OpenMW support, but you should use newest builds anyway.
